# Azure Communication Chat Service client library for iOS

This package contains the Chat client library for Azure Communication Services.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/main/sdk/communication/AzureCommunicationChat)
| [API reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-ios/AzureCommunicationChat/index.html)
| [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* The client library is written in modern Swift 5. Due to this, Xcode 10.2 or higher is required to use this library.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
[Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource) to use this library.

### Install the library
To install the Azure client libraries for iOS, we recommend you use
[Swift Package Manager](#add-a-package-dependency-with-swift-package-manager).
As an alternative, you may also integrate the libraries using
[CocoaPods](#integrate-the-client-libraries-with-cocoapods).

#### Add a package dependency with Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code.
Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Xcode comes with built-in support for Swift Package Manager and source control accounts and makes it easy to leverage
available Swift packages. Use Xcode to manage the versions of package dependencies and make sure your project has the
most up-to-date code changes.

##### Xcode

**Important:** AzureCommunicationChat currently does not support arm64 for iOS Simulator. If you are developing on M1 please run Xcode with Rosetta. See [#787](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/issues/787)

To add the library to your application, follow the instructions in
[Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app):

In order to independently version packages with Swift Package Manager, we mirror the code from azure-sdk-for-ios into separate
repositories. Your Swift Package Manager-based app should target these repositories instead of the azure-sdk-for-ios repo.

With your project open in Xcode 11 or later, select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...** Enter the
clone URL of the Swift Package Manager mirror repository: *https://github.com/Azure/SwiftPM-AzureCommunicationChat.git*
and click **Next**. For the version rule, specify the exact version or version range you wish to use with your application and
click **Next**. Finally, place a checkmark next to the library, ensure your application target is selected in the **Add to target**
dropdown, and click **Finish**.

##### Swift CLI

To add the library to your application, follow the example in
[Importing Dependencies](https://swift.org/package-manager/#importing-dependencies):

Open your project's `Package.swift` file and add a new package dependency to your project's `dependencies` section,
specifying the clone URL of this repository and the version specifier you wish to use:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(name: "AzureCommunicationChat", url: "https://github.com/Azure/SwiftPM-AzureCommunicationChat.git", from: "1.3.0")
    ],
```

Next, for each target that needs to use the library, add it to the target's array of `dependencies`:
```swift
    targets: [
        ...
        .target(
            name: "MyTarget",
            dependencies: ["AzureCommunicationChat", ...])
    ]
)
```

#### Integrate the client libraries with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective C and Swift projects. You can install it with
the following command:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.5+ is required.

To integrate one or more client libraries into your project using CocoaPods, specify them in your
[Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html), providing the version specifier you wish to use. To
ensure compatibility when using multiple client libraries in the same project, use the same version specifier for all
Azure SDK client libraries within the project:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'

# Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
use_frameworks!

target 'MyTarget' do
  pod 'AzureCommunicationChat', '1.3.0'
  ...
end
```

## Key concepts

### User and User Access Tokens

User access tokens enable you to build client applications that directly authenticate to Azure Communication Services. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens) to learn how to create a user and issue a User Access Token.

The id for the user created above will be necessary later to add said user as a participant of a new chat thread. The initiator of the create request must be in the list of participants of the chat thread.

### Chat Thread

A chat conversation is represented by a chat thread. Each user in the thread is called a thread participant. Thread participants can chat with one another privately in a 1:1 chat or huddle up in a 1:N group chat.

Using the APIs, users can also send typing indicators when typing a message and read receipts for the messages they have read in a chat thread. To learn more, read about chat concepts [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/chat/concepts).

### ChatClient

`ChatClient` is used for performing chat thread operations, listed below.

#### Initialization

To instantiate a ChatClient you will need the CommunicationServices resource endpoint, a CommunicationTokenCredential created from a User Access Token, and optional options to create the client with.

```swift
import AzureCommunicationCommon
import AzureCommunicationChat
import AzureCore

let endpoint = "<communication_resource_endpoint>"

let credential = try CommunicationTokenCredential(<"user_access_token>")

let options = AzureCommunicationChatClientOptions(
	logger: ClientLoggers.default,
	dispatchQueue: self.queue
)

let chatClient = ChatClient(endpoint: endpoint, credential: credential, withOptions: options)

```

#### Thread Operations

ChatClient supports the following methods, see the links below for examples.

- [Create a thread](#create-a-thread)
- [Get a threads properties](#get-a-threads-properties)
- [List threads](#list-threads)
- [Delete a thread](#delete-a-thread)
- [Get a thread client](#get-a-thread-client)

### ChatThreadClient

`ChatThreadClient` provides methods for operations within a chat thread, such as messaging and managing participants.

#### Initialization

ChatThreadClients should be created through the ChatClient. A ChatThreadClient is associated with a specific chat thread and is used to perform operations within the thread. See the list below for examples of each operation that ChatThreadClient supports.

- [Get a message](#get-a-message)
- [List messages](#list-messages)
- [Update a message](#update-a-message)
- [Delete a message](#delete-a-message)
- [Receive messages from a thread](#receive-messages-from-a-thread)

#### Thread Participant Operations

- [Get thread participants](#get-thread-participants)
- [Add thread participants](#add-thread-participants)
- [Remove a thread participant](#remove-a-thread-participant)

#### Events Operations

- [Send a typing notification](#send-a-typing-notification)
- [Send read receipt](#send-read-receipt)
- [Get read receipts](#get-read-receipts)

#### Thread Update Operations
- [Update the thread topic](#update-thread-topic)

## Examples

### Thread Operations

#### Create a thread

Use the `create` method of `ChatClient` to create a new thread.

Thread creation may result in partial errors, meaning the thread was successfully created but certain participants failed to be added. Participants that failed to be added will be listed as part of the response.

- `CreateChatThreadRequest` is the model to pass to this method. It contains the topic of the thread as well as the optional participants to create the thread with.

- `CreateChatThreadResult` is the result returned from creating a thread.
- `chatThread` is the `ChatThreadProperties` of the thread that was created.
- `invalidParticipants` is an array of errors for any participants that failed to be added to the thread.

```swift
let thread = CreateChatThreadRequest(
    topic: "General"
)

chatClient.create(thread: thread) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(chatThreadResult):
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Get a threads properties

Use the `getProperties` method of `ChatThreadClient` to retrieve a threads properties.
- `ChatThreadProperties` is the type that is returned. It contains information about the thread including the thread ID, the topic, when it was created or deleted, and who created it.

```swift
chatThreadClient.getProperties { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(chatThreadProperties):
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### List threads

Use the `listThreads` method to retrieve a list of threads.

- `ListChatThreadsOptions` is the object representing the options to pass.
- `maxPageSize`, optional, is the maximum number of messages to be returned per page. The limit can be found from https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/service-limits.
- `startTime`, optional, is the thread start time to consider in the query.

`PagedCollection<ChatThreadItem>` is the response returned from listing threads.
`ChatThreadItem` represents a summary of information about the thread including the thread ID, topic, time of deletion, and time of last message received, as applicable.

```swift
import AzureCore
let options = ListChatThreadsOptions(maxPageSize: 1)
chatClient.listThreads(withOptions: options) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(listThreadsResponse):
        var iterator = listThreadsResponse.syncIterator
        while let threadItem = iterator.next() {
            // Take further action
        }

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```


#### Delete a thread

Use the `delete` method of `ChatClient` to delete a thread.

- `thread` is the unique ID of the thread.

```swift
chatClient.delete(thread: threadId) { result, httpResponse in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

### Message Operations

#### Send a message

Use the `send` method of `ChatThreadClient` to send a message to a thread.

- `SendChatMessageRequest` is the model to pass to this method.
- `content`, required, is used to provide the chat message content.
- `senderDisplayName` is used to specify the display name of the sender, if not specified, an empty name will be set.
- `type` is the type of message being sent, the supported types are text and html.
- `metadata` is any additional metadata you would like to send with the message.

`SendChatMessageResult` is the response returned from sending a message, it contains the unique ID of the message.

```swift
let message = SendChatMessageRequest(
    content: "Test message 1",
    senderDisplayName: "An Important person"
)

chatThreadClient.send(message: message) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(createMessageResponse):
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Get a message

Use the `get` method of `ChatThreadClient` to retrieve a message in a thread.

- `message` is the unique ID of the message to retrieve.

`ChatMessage` is the response returned from getting a message. This object contains information about the message type, content, sender, the sequence of the message in the conversation, as well as information around when the message was created, deleted or edited.

```swift
chatThreadClient.get(message: messageId) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(message):
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### List messages

Use the `listMessages` method of `ChatThreadClient` to retrieve messages in a thread.

- `ListChatMessagesOptions` is the optional object representing the options to pass.
- `maxPageSize`, optional, is the maximum number of messages to be returned per page. The limit can be found from https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/service-limits.
- `startTime`, optional, is the thread start time to consider in the query.

`<PagedCollection<ChatMessage>` is the response returned from listing messages

```swift
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ"

var options: ListChatMessagesOptions? = nil
if let date = dateFormatter.date(from: "2020-08-27T17:55:50Z") {
    options = ListChatMessagesOptions(
        startTime: date
    )
}

client.listMessages(withOptions: options) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(listMessagesResponse):
        var iterator = listMessagesResponse.syncIterator
        while let message = iterator.next() {
            // Take further action
        }

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Update a message

Use the `update` method of `ChatThreadClient` to update the content of a message.

- `message` is the unique ID of the message.
- `parameters` contains the message content to be updated.

```swift
let updatedContent = {
    content: "Updated message content"
}
chatThreadClient.update(message: messageId, parameters: updatedContent) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success(_):
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Delete a message

Use the `delete` method of `ChatThreadClient` to delete a message in a thread.

- `message` is the unique ID of the message.

```swift
chatThreadClient.delete(message: messageId) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Receive messages from a thread

With realtime notifications enabled you can receive events when messages are sent to the thread.
To enable realtime notifications use the `startRealtimeNotifications` method of `ChatClient`. Starting notifications is an asynhronous operation.

```swift
chatClient.startRealTimeNotifications() { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Notifications started
    case let.failure(error):
        // Handle failure
    }
}
```

To receive messages for a thread, use the `register` method of `ChatClient`.

```swift
func handler (response: Any, eventId: ChatEventId) {
    // Handle chatMessageReceived event
}

chatClient.register(event: ChatEventId.chatMessageReceived, handler: handler)

```

### Thread Participant Operations

#### Get thread participants

Use the `listParticipants` of `ChatThreadClient` method to retrieve the participants of the thread.


`PagedCollection<ChatParticipant>` is the response returned from listing participants.
`ChatParticipant` contains the identifier which holds the unique ACS user ID for this participant, as well as optional display name and share history time.

```swift
chatThreadClient.listParticipants() { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(threadParticipants):
        var iterator = threadParticipants.syncIterator
        while let threadParticipants = iterator.next() {
            // Take further action
        }

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Add thread participants

Use the `add` method to add one or more participants to a thread.

- `participants` is an array of `ChatParticipant`'s to add
- `AddChatParticipantsResult` is the model returned, it contains an invalidParticipants property that has an array of ChatErrors describing any participants that failed to be added to the chat.

```swift
let threadParticipants = [ChatParticipant(
        id: userIdentifier,
        displayName: "a new participant"
    )]

chatThreadClient.add(participants: threadParticipants) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(result):
        // Check for invalid participants

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Remove a thread participant

Use the `remove` method of `ChatThreadClient` to remove a participant from a thread.

- `participant` is the identifier of the participant to remove.

```swift
chatThreadClient.remove(participant: participantIdentifier) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

### Events Operations

#### Send a typing notification

Use the `sendTypingNotification` method of `ChatThreadClient` to post a typing notification event to a thread, on behalf of a user.

```swift
chatThreadClient.sendTypingNotification() { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Send read receipt

Use the `sendReadReceipt` method of `ChatThreadClient` to post a read receipt event to a thread, on behalf of a user.

-`forMessage` refers to the unique ID of the message that the read receipt is for.

```swift

chatThreadClient.sendReadReceipt(forMessage: messageId) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Get read receipts

Use the `listReadReceipts` method of `ChatThreadClient` to retrieve read receipts for a thread.

`PagedCollection<ChatMessageReadReceipt>` is the response returned from listing read receipts. `ChatMessageReadReceipt` contains the sender of the read receipt, the id of the message that was read, and the time that the message was read.

```swift
chatThreadClient.listReadReceipts() { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(readReceipts):
        var iterator = readReceipts.syncIterator
        while let readReceipt = iterator.next() {
            // Take further action
        }

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

### Thread Update Operations

#### Update the thread's topic

Use the `update` method of `ChatThreadClient` to update a thread's topic.

- `topic` is the thread's new topic.

```swift
let newTopic = "My new thread topic"

chatThreadClient.update(topic: newTopic) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

When an error occurs, the client calls the callback, passing in a `failure` result. You can use the provided error to act upon the failure.

```swift
client.create(thread: thread) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```
