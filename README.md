# Azure SDK for iOS

This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for iOS. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-ios).

> Note: The Azure SDK for iOS replaces a previous offering, known as Azure.iOS. Source code and documentation for Azure.iOS is available in the [legacy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/legacy) branch.

## Getting started

For your convenience, each service has a separate set of libraries that you can choose to use instead of one, large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.

### Prerequisites

* The client libraries are written in modern Swift 5. Due to this, Xcode 10.2 or higher is required to use these libraries.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to use these libraries.

### Libraries available

Releases of all libraries are available here: [releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/releases)

Currently, the following client libraries are in **beta**. These libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for iOS](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/ios_introduction.html) and share a number of core features such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc., so that once you learn how to use these features in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries. You can learn about these shared features in [AzureCore](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/blob/main/sdk/core/AzureCore/README.md).

#### Core
- [AzureCore](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/blob/main/sdk/core/AzureCore/)

> Note: The SDK is currently in **beta**. The API surface and feature sets are subject to change at any time before they become generally available. We do not currently recommend them for production use.

### Install the libraries
To install the Azure client libraries for iOS, we recommend you use
[Swift Package Manager](#add-a-package-dependency-with-swift-package-manager).
As an alternative, you may also integrate the libraries using
[CocoaPods](#integrate-the-client-libraries-with-cocoapods).

See the README file for individual libraries for instructions.
