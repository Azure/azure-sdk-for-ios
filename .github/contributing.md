# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

As this is an active (pre 1.0) project, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/Azure/Azure.iOS/issues/new) for new features so that they can be discussed before submitting pull requests. Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome!

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.
